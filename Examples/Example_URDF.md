# MPC and robotics: using an URDF to generate a prediction model

## Introduction

This examples illustrates how to generate an MPC solver by parsing a prediction model obtained from an URDF file. This code is based on [URDF2Casadi](https://github.com/robotology/urdf2casadi-matlab) from the library [Robotology](https://github.com/robotology).

The example is a simple inverted pendulum.
